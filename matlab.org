\begin{equation}
c(x,t,u,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x})\frac{\partial u}{\partial
t}=x^{-m}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x^mf(x,t,u,\frac{\partial
u}{\partial x}))+s(x,t,u,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x})
\end{equation}
The pde hold for t_o \ll t \ll t_f and a\ll x\ll b, m can be 0,1,2 corresponding to slab,cylindral, spherical symmetry
respectively. if m>0 then a>0 must also hold.
***** SUITABLE REGION
The MATLAB PDE solver, pdepe, solves initial-boundary value problems for systems of parabolic and elliptic PDEs in the one space variable x and time t. There must be at least one parabolic equation in the system.
***** DEPENDS
The pdepe solver converts the PDEs to ODEs using a second-order
accurate spatial discretization based on a fixed set of user-specified
nodes.Discretization method:[[http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/selected-bibliography-for-differential-equations.html#f1-697835][here]]. The time integration is done with
